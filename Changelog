Fixes to original osmconvert

1> --in-josm - no longer required, will now parse either ' or " format
	       so osmconvert can simultaneously handle files of both format.
	Fix corruption of temporary file when --in-josm used.

2> Handle relation id's greater than 2^15 as used by Free OSM.

3> Increase number of input files from 400 to 1002 to handle entire
   minute-replicate directory, osm file and temp file if system has enough ram.

4> Error message for bounding box missing "=".
